# LuceneNet303r2
Lucene.Net 3.0.3 r2 compiled with .NET Standard

I claim no ownership of this code. I encountered issues using the Lucene.Net v3.0.3 nuget pkg with my .NET Core 3/Standard2.1 code. So I created this repo that I can use instead. It's my understanding that this is allowed under Lucene.Net's Apache 2 license.
